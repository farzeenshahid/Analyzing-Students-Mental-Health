# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health
## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes student data to examine the impact of the length of stay (stay) on the average mental health diagnostic scores of international students. The study focuses on three key psychological assessments:

- PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) for depression (todep)
- SCS (Self-Compassion Scale) for self-compassion (tosc)
- ASISS (Academic Stress Inventory for Secondary Students) for academic stress (toas)
## Usage
This project can be used for analyzing trends in mental health among international students based on their duration of stay, helping institutions develop targeted support strategies.
